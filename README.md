# jinius's zmk-config

This is my personal [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/) configuration.
This is for my 42-keys corne keyboard.

This branch is updated for the latest ZMK firmware.

## Tasks for Highlights
- create a layer layout as mentioned by [Miryoku ZMK](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_zmk)
- add urob's [zmk-nodefree-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-nodefree-config) to add functionality
- enable local and github action build for all the release versions
- use [Caps Word](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/caps-word) in place of <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>.
- prefer [Toggle Layer](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/layers#toggle-layer) along with [Tap Dance](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/tap-dance) to work on a layer
- configure [mouse keys on the host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_keys) by following the steps mentioned at [Miryoku ZMK](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_zmk#mouse-keys)
- provide a keymap image file using one of these options (or may be all of them): [keymap-drawer](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer), [Keymap Editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor#keymap-editor)
- register the repo with [KeymapDB](https://keymapdb.com/) at some point in time
